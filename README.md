# Stack_Queue_Deque
This is a project I did for my Data Structures class in which I created three related data structures using both array and linked list implementations. 
For this project, I used my own linked list implementaion that I made from scratch, which is avaliable on [this](https://github.com/sambrothers0/Linked_List) public repository. 
There is also a test file in which I wrote test cases to comprehensively test my code against all bugs for every implementation.
Also included is an example use case for when a stack may be useful, where a text file is scanned for delimiters like parentheses and brackets, and a stack is used to determine if there are any lone delimiters without a partner.
