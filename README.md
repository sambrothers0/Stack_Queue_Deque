# Stack_Queue_Deque
This is a project I did for my Data Structures class in which I created 3 data related data structures using both array and linked list implementations. 
I also coded my own linked list from scratch, which is avaliable on my github in a repository called "linked_list"
There is also a test file in which I wrote test cases to comprehensively test my code against all bugs for every implementation.
Also included is an example use case for when a stack may be useful, where a text file is scanned for delimiters like parentheses and brackets, and a stack is used to determine if there are any lone delimiters without a partner.
