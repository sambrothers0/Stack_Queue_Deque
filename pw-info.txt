Deque Stack Queue
I implemented a deque from scratch with both the functionality of a stack and queue. Thorough understanding of these data structures are fundamental to any programmer, so I coded a deque, which acts as a double ended stack and can be pushed or popped from either end. Using Python, I made two different programs with identical functionality, but different structures: one array-based, and one with a custom linked list I made from scratch. Upon completion, I learned about the benefits and drawbacks of each implementation.
